{"name":"Mahendra","desc":"Mahendra Koota is formed when the groom’s Nakshatra is 4th, 7th or 10th Nakshatra from the bride’s. Usually the 4th Nakshatra is the Mahendra Koota and the 4th Nakshatra of the bride to the groom’s 4th is called Upendra Nakshatra. As per Vedic Astrology, it is very auspicious for the couple if the bride’s Nakshatra is the 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22 or 25th from the groom’s Nakshatra. Mahendra Koota is used in predicting post marriage financial life of the couple. The Upendra Koota is used in determining the happiness from the child. If Mahendra koota is matched it is to be presumed that the couple will have children.","remedies":""}
