{"name":"Strii Deergha","desc":"South Indian astrology follows the principles of Devarshi Narada. This is also known as Stree Dirgha or Kanya Door. In this method the groom’s Nakshatra is counted from the Nakshatra of the bride. 3 circles each are formed by 9 Nakshatras. According to Indian astrology a couple will have an uncompromising relationship if the groom’s Nakshatra is in the first 9 just before the bride’s Nakshatra. Similarly if the groom’s Nakshatra is in the second 9 from the bride’s nakshatra then married life will be normal. And if the groom’s Nakshatra is situated in the 3rd circle of 9 planets it is considered excellent for the couple. In this case the duo will have a very loving married life. If the boys Nakshatra is within the same line of Nakshatra, then it is considered bad. Placement of groom’s Nakshatra from 19th to 27th is considered even better. This arrangement in the marriage Kundali blesses the couple with many children and strengthens their love and relationship.This is also good for the happy married life and longevity of the couple. According to the sayings of Devarshi Narada some distance between the Nakshatras of male and female is auspicious. If while counting it is determined that the couple’s Nakshatras fall close to each other it may not be a favorable sign for their married life as it reduces the positive results. But this verdict is contradictory to the Nridur Dosha.","remedies":""}
