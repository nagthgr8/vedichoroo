Paap Kartari Dosha is formed when a planet is hemmed between 2 malefic planets in the birth chart. The hemmed planet & the house where it is positioned can reveal the type of sins one committed in past life, and the malefics and the houses around hemmed planet can further reveal from where the problems are coming from. Such effects are seen during the dasha & transit of such planets. For ex: saturn in 9th & Mars in 11th can damage the10th house related to ones career","remedies":"<strong>Chant Hanuman Chalisa 108 times every Tuesday</strong><br><strong>Donate masoor dal to 3 beggers on Wednesdays</strong><br><strong>Perform Rudrabhishek to Lord Shiv on Mondays during Shravan Maas.</strong><br><strong>On Saturdays every morning, watch your face in the oil & offer to Lord Shani Dev</strong>"}
