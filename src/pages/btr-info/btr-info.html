	<h2>Birth Time Rectification or BTR?</h2>
	<p class="desc">There is quite a possibility in many cases that the given birth time maynot be accurate. There is a big debate over when to consider a child birth? Is it when umblical cord is cutoff or when child cries out the first time? Scientifically it has been proven that when the child cry first time, life begins & the birth time should be cosidered from this point. BTR is a process of rectifying birth time if the given birth time is not accurate. So, many of us will have a question how can astrologer come to know if the given birth time is accurate or not. Yes, this is possible through various methods in Astrology, it is belived in Astrology that there will be connection within the ruling planets at the time of birth, to jusify this you can try giving a fake birth time & see if our KP system is displaying that the birth time needs correction. Yes, thats the miracle of life. Even manytimes in ciserian cases it was seen that the fixed time or if the time given by astrologer or priest is not in compliance with the ruling planets for child birth will not work, we would see in such cases that the ciserian gets postphoned or prephoned. Thats the secret of Nature. Our App uses KP method to check if weather the given birth time is accurate or needs a correction. Our system will perform 3 level ruling planet check for birth time accuracy.</p>
	<h2>How to correct birth time?</h2>
	<p class="desc">When our App displays that the birth time needs correction, just add or subtract the minutes by 1 to the time of birth till the alert goes away. While adding or subtracting minutes whichever is worked, you will need to consider the closest one. In many cases such fine tuning would work, but there maybe some cases where the given birth time is not close enough or birth time is unknown in which case Astrologer has to use Horary method for birth time justification. Talk to our Astrologer for more details.</p>
