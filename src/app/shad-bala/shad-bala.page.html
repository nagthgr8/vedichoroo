Retrogression can be equated with moving against the river current, which is extremely tough.
Movement of Surya and Chandra are always steady, and they never have retrogression or acceleration, hence their Chestabala equates to their Ayana Bala and Paksha Bala respectively. For the Tara Grahas (Mangal to Shani), their Chestabala is computed based on their speed and direction of their motion.
The Chesta Bala can be known from the speed of the Grahas. </ion-col></ion-row>
