      In loving memory of the memories that my dear brother <strong>Krishna Mohan (Bujji)</strong> and I shared during our younger days. Although Bujji is no longer with me, the memories we created together will forever be cherished and remembered.
      <br><br>
      Bujji was more than just a brother to me; he was a friend, a confidant, and a constant source of support and encouragement. I recall the times we spent together during our college days, and our movie nights were a source of great relief and joy for me. Bujji always showed me a great deal of respect and love, even during our most challenging moments.
      <br><br>
      Although Bujji has left home, I know that he is still alive somewhere out there, and I hope he is doing well. This mobile app is dedicated to the memories we created together, as a testament to the bond we shared and the love that will always remain.
      <br><br>
      Wherever you are, dear brother, I want you to know that you hold a special place in my heart, and I will always treasure the memories we created together. May you find happiness and fulfillment in your life's journey, and may our paths cross once again someday.
